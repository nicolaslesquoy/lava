## Description

`lava` is a C/C++ GPGPU computing library based on Vulkan. It is designed to provide a simple and easy-to-use API for developers to write GPGPU computing programs in C/C++. **It is a work-in-progress project and is not yet ready for production use.**

This library will rely on [VulkanMemoryAllocator (VMA)](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator) and [vk-Bootstrap](https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap) for Vulkan initialization.
